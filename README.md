NodeJS server for discord webhooks

# How to use
1. see `config.json.example` and create `config.json`
2. `npm run`

# Why
Discord don't provide webhooks for events, only websockets. But this way too hard for some developers.
This server provide own webhook implementation for unlimited count of bots.
